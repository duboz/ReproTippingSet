# ReproTippingSet
Julia implementation of the algorithms developped by J. Mathias et al.
The algorithm can be deduced from the article "tipping point to tipping set: Extending the concept of regime shift to uncertain dynamics for real-world applications." by Jean-Denis Mathias, Guillaume Deffuant ans Antoine Brias.
